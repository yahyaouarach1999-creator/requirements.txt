Isolate 'Compliance' vs 'Credit' holds.<br>2. **CREDIT OVERRIDE:** Cross-reference SFDC 'Payment Performance'. If >95% on-time, use the 'Finance Fast-Track' Slack channel for a temporary limit increase.<br>3. **TRADE COMPLIANCE:** Check 'GTS Status'.

Match IP addresses against company VPN ranges. Identify compromised accounts.<br>3. **CISO NOTIFICATION:** Inform the CISO and Legal. Prepare a 'Customer Impact Statement' identifying viewed datasets.<br>4. **RECOVERY:** Reset 2FA and clear hardware through 'Endpoint Security' before restoring CRM access.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550751827-4bd374c3f58b?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80
